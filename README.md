# Internal wave libraries

 - Solve 1D KdV equation
 - Calculate linear dynamic modes

---

# TODO

## Pre-processing
 
 - Nonlinear EOS into IWaveModes class
 - Density profile fitting option (in addition pchipinterpolator)
 - Wrapper class for running a kdv model
     - Different density, initial condition, and solver options
     - NetCDF output options
     - Run as script or via command line (read yaml input file)

## KdV Solver

 - ~~Move all kdvlamb functions into isw.py~~

## Tests
 
 - ~~Lamb and Yan, 1996 comparison notebook~~
 - Browse Basin (Prelude, April 2017) comparison
 - North Rankin
 
## Post-processing

 - Animated notebook
 - QT GUI
