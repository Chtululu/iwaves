# TODO

## Physics

 - Closure model for viscosity
 - ~~Bottom friction term~~ 
 - Vertical shear with analytical comparison

## Pre-processing
 
 - ~~Nonlinear EOS into IWaveModes class~~
 - ~~Density profile fitting option (in addition pchipinterpolator)~~
 - ~~Variable-spaced mesh eigenvalue solver~~
 - Wrapper function for running a kdv model
     - ~~Different initial condition, and solver options~~
     - ~~NetCDF output options~~
     - Run as script or via command line (read yaml input file)

## KdV Solver

 - ~~Move all kdvlamb functions into isw.py~~

## Tests / Tutorials
 
 - ~~Lamb and Yan, 1996 comparison notebook~~
        - Still needs to be validated
 - Example notebook using a measured temperature profile
 - Batch run
 - Parallel batch run

## Post-processing

 - Animated notebook
 - ~~GUI~~
